            <strong>Achieveing Fairness and Performance while Serving LLMs Amid Diverse Applications.</strong>
            <em>Summer 2024</em><br>
            <span>Research Intern, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/m365-research/">AIOps and Efficient AI at Microsoft</a></span><br>
            <span>Advisor: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/ankurmallick/">Dr. Ankur Mallick</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/aparayil/">Dr. Anjaly Parayil</a></span><br>
            <p>
                Developed an application-characteristic-aware request throttling mechanism combined with a weighted service counter-based scheduling technique to mitigate abusive behaviors and promote fairness in Microsoft's CoPilot LLM serving platform, improving the experience for millions of users.

            <strong>Workload characteristic-aware ML Systems.</strong>
            <em>Fall 2020 - Present</em><br>
            <span>Ph.D. Thesis Research, Advisor: <a href="https://people.cs.vt.edu/butta/">Dr. Ali R Butt</a></span><br>
            <p>
                Existing platforms frequently waste resources when handling DDL, FL, and LLM workloads, as they lack optimization for the unique demands of these tasks. My thesis aims to infuse intelligence into these systems to maximize quality, efficiency, autonomy, and adaptability with minimal human intervention. Additionally, it focuses on enriching user experience and satisfaction in cloud services through AI-driven insights, while integrating AI/ML across the software development lifecycle to boost productivity and streamline processes end-to-end.

            <strong><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9284294">Container Usage Patterns in HPC Scenarios.</a></strong>
            <em>Fall 2019 - Summer 2020</em><br>
            <span>PhD Research Project, Advisor: <a href="https://people.cs.vt.edu/butta/">Dr. Ali R Butt</a></span><br>
            <p>
                Although the usage of containers has peaked in the recent years, its characteristics when used in HPC scenarios had been left unexplored.
                The goal of this project was to understand those patterns so that bottlenecks could be removed and improved architectures could be designed.

            <p>
                Examined current performance with different datatypes in Yaksa Pack/Unpack Library of MPICH, developed scripts to implement optimizations in performance, created benchmarks for providing insights into performance optimization scenarios, and designed an auto-tuner to explore a search space for optimizations.
